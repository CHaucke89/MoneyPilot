# THIS IS AN "UNSAFE" FORK AND WILL GET YOUR DEVICE BANNED FROM COMMA'S SERVERS
This is a personal fork of sunnypilot specifically made for my Kia EV6 that pretty much breaks most of comma's rules. If you do not want to be banned from comma connect, do NOT use this with uploads enabled and be sure to delete all rlogs before switching back to a safe fork and re-enabling uploads. If you do not use comma connect or use an alternative like konik.ai, then there's nothing to worry about.
